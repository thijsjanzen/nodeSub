\title{
	Package providing functions to simulate sequences under different DNA evolution models
}
\description{
    Simulate DNA sequences for the node substitution model.
    In the node substitution model, substitutions accumulate additionally
    during a speciation event, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for
    substitution rate variation. This package provides tools to simulate
    such a process, simulate a reference process with only substitutions along
    the branches, and provides tools to infer phylogenies from alignments. More
    information can be found in Janzen (2021) <doi:10.1093/sysbio/syab085>.
